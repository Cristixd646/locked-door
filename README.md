## Locked door powered by Arduino
Simple &amp; fun Arduino project to do when you're bored.
If you want to keep something safe (e.g. Documents, money or anything else) you can follow these simple steps :). I am using a fingerprint sensor and a 12v lock controlled by a relay.
## Instructions
1. Download & install the required library from [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Fingerprint-Sensor-Library)
2. Download the .ino file
3. Upload code to board
